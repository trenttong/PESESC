ESESC + BINFMT

 -Patch follow path (path.c in qemu) to use 

   +the VMroot directory

   +create a "fake" home. E.g: search for /home/renau and map it to XXXX

   +dev and proc should be left untouched

   -patch the syscall.c:execve to use the new ABI (VM). This should be done
    even because relative calls still can go to native. E.g: ./pp.sh can call
    pp2.sh, but it will use the x86 sh instead of arm

-----------------------------------

 1-Time optimization

 1.1-Remove the .scheduleAbs (and only use schedule but with an "abs meaning").
Many bugs are in this tricky optimization.

 1.2-Remove TimeDelta_t from the code

 1.3-Change Time_t to a double (float is not enough)


 sesctherm TODO:

  -Make sure that everything is correctly tabulated

  -Change the everything is included every time

  -Do not use assert, use I() from nannassert

  -Set the correct copyrights (only UCSC, but similar to the rest of esesc copyrights)

  -Do not use "using namespace std" by default.
