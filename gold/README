The examples here will be based on this default configuration.
~/esesc         #This is where esesc has been downloaded to
~/build         #This is where esesc will be compiled to

1. The regression tests have been incorporated into the esesc conf directory.
   No additional command line argument are needed for the benchmarks.

   Example:
   user@mada:~$ mkdir build
   user@mada:~/build$ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DESESC_QEMU_ISA=armel \
                      ~/esesc

2. Prepare a set of golden outputs from report.pl that you want to compare against 
   (i.e. these outputs would be most useful to generate before you update the ESESC 
   code).

   user@mada:~/build$ make gold

   The command "make gold" will make a SLOW configuration golden-brick and a FAST 
   configuration golden-brick.

3. After a code change, run

   user@mada:~/build$ make regression

   which will compare a new report.pl output to the golden-brick outputs. Examine
   the command line for errors. Navigate to ~/build/regression/output/ to view the 
   output and errors (if there were any). 

   The output will consist of SLOW.last:SLOW.gold, FAST.last:FAST.gold, 
   SLOW.last:FAST.last. CAT them each and examine the matrix for OK and ERROR. If 
   all OK, then the values are relatively close (according to the epsilon defined 
   in ~/esesc/gold/tables/cmptab-eq.sh).

4. The scripts "make gold" and "make regression" will create the directories
   ~/build/regression/run and run the script mt-scripts.rb to generate benchmark
   testing files.

4. If esesc has not been compiled, "make regression/gold" will compile esesc with
   2 cores.

DIRECTORY ORGANIZATION
-----------------
~/build
This is our compiled esesc.

~/build/regression/run
This is where the benchmark scripts and the ruby script used to generate the
benchmark scripts live.

~/build/regression/output
This is the final directory to check your results in.

~/esesc
This is our uncompiled esesc binary.

~/esesc/gold/config
This has all of the shared.conf files that we can use when running ESESC. Substitute
MILD or MEDIUM for SLOW or FAST.

~/esesc/gold/exe
This is our esesc executable. The script runs the executable and generates a 
report.pl. The results are then arranged into a table.

~/esesc/gold/log
This is where all the ESESC stdout/stderr redirection is written to.

~/esesc/gold/exe/maketable.sh
This script runs ESESC with the specified shared.conf file (sh maketable.sh < SLOW 
MILD MEDIUM or FAST> and makes a table of the output across several benchmarks
and comparing 5 metrics.

~/esesc/gold/report
This is where the individual report.pl goes after running the scripts.

~/esesc/gold/tables
This is where the otuput of maketable.sh goes. Here you will find timestamped
(YYMMDD-HHMM) tables. The syntax is <shared.conf type>.YYMMDD-HHMM.csv
